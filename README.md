# Fuze Telegram Mini App

A Telegram-first, modular web application that brings **wallet + gaming + prediction markets + discovery + campaigns + events** into one lightweight experience. Built as a set of focused microservices with offâ€‘chain custody today and clean adapters for onâ€‘chain tomorrow.

> This README frames the *why* and the *what*: story, opportunity, target users, benefits, FUZE utility, monetization, growth, and how we help crypto projects.

---

## 1) App Story

* **Problem**: Crypto communities live on Telegram, but most actions (earn, play, discover, support projects) are fragmented across bots, spreadsheets, and thirdâ€‘party sites. Users drop off; projects canâ€™t activate, retain, or measure.
* **Solution**: A **single Telegram Mini App** where users can:

  * Manage an **offâ€‘chain wallet** (STAR/FZ/PT/FUZE/USDT) with frictionless deposits/withdrawals.
  * **Play** headâ€‘toâ€‘head games (via PlayHub) and join **CFB** (Crypto Fair Bet) markets using inâ€‘app currencies.
  * **Discover** tokens/projects with watchlists, alerts, news, and signals.
  * Complete **campaigns/airdrops** with verifiable tasks; get paid instantly.
  * Browse **events** and jump to booking links.
* **Design principles**: instant boot (Telegram), fullyâ€‘collateralized flows, strict idempotency, auditability, and a clear path to onâ€‘chain when/where it helps.

---

## 2) Business Opportunity

* **Where users are**: Telegram hosts thousands of crypto communities; Mini Apps remove install friction and boost trust via the parent bot.
* **Multiâ€‘surface engagement**: games + prediction + quests + discovery + events = higher session count and timeâ€‘onâ€‘platform.
* **Liquidity & intent**: CFB and Escrow create *priced* intent data (who risks what on which assets), valuable for projects and partners.
* **Distribution flywheel**: campaigns fund user rewards which cycle back into games/CFB, increasing balances and activity, lowering CAC.
* **Expandable rails**: offâ€‘chain first makes compliance and iteration fast; future onâ€‘chain adapters unlock new partner ecosystems.

---

## 3) Participants (Target Users)

* **Everyday Crypto Users**: want fun, light games, simple prediction markets, quick rewards, and curated info without leaving Telegram.
* **Active Traders/Power Users**: track assets, set alerts, participate in fair bets, and use OTC escrow for P2P deals.
* **Project Teams & Creators**: launch campaigns/airdrops, list events, share updates, and observe engagement metrics.
* **Event Organizers / Communities**: publish meetups or AMAs, drive to booking sites, and optionally gate perks via campaigns.
* **Partners/Exchanges/Wallets** (Phaseâ€‘2): coâ€‘market listings, provide liquidity or sponsor campaigns.

---

## 4) Benefits to Participants/Users

* **One place, zero friction**: open in Telegram; auth via WebApp HMAC.
* **Instant actions**: holds/settlements are fast and final; no manual proofs.
* **Transparent economics**: CFB shows exact rake (7%), fullyâ€‘collateralized payouts, and auditable oracle reports.
* **Earn & engage**: campaigns reward tasks; games/CFB create skillâ€‘andâ€‘conviction based upside.
* **Signalâ€‘rich discovery**: watchlists, alerts, curated news, and simple momentum/mention signals.
* **Safety**: Escrow for P2P with dual holds and dispute tools (offâ€‘chain v1).

---

## 5) FUZE Utility & Ecosystem Impact

> FUZE is the ecosystem token; the app increases its **velocity, demand, and stickiness** via these mechanisms.

* **Unit of account (internal conversions)**: FUZE â†’ FZ/PT (or future credit units) with configurable fees, creating **conversion demand**.
* **Fee token & discounts**: pay platform rake/fees in FUZE for discounts or tiered benefits (Phaseâ€‘2), driving **explicit FUZE utility**.
* **Staking for access** (Phaseâ€‘2): stake FUZE to unlock higher limits (CFB sizes, campaign budgets) or to list projects/events.
* **Treasury sinks**: portions of rakes/fees denominated in FZ/PT can be periodically **market-bought into FUZE** to bolster treasury or burn.
* **Ecosystem rails**: campaigns airdrop FUZE or FUZEâ€‘denominated rewards; discovery surfaces FUZEâ€‘centric promotions.

---

## 6) Platform Monetization (How we earn)

* **CFB Rake**: 7% of the **losing side** (configurable per config repo). Transparent and programmatic.
* **Game Rakes/Fees**: small perâ€‘match rake or room fee (gameâ€‘specific).
* **Conversion Spreads**: configurable basis points for STARâ†”FZâ†”PTâ†”FUZE (via Payhub conversions).
* **Escrow Fees**: fixed or bps fee on completed P2P trades; optional dispute fee.
* **Sponsored Campaigns**: projects pay for budgets, featured placements, or costâ€‘perâ€‘completedâ€‘task.
* **Data/Insights (optâ€‘in)**: aggregate, anonymized performance insights for projects (activity funnels, campaign efficacy).

---

## 7) Growth Levers & Loops (Opportunity for Growth)

* **Kâ€‘factor via campaigns**: referral tasks and squad quests create viral loops with measurable ROI.
* **Creator/Game ecosystem**: thirdâ€‘party game servers integrate through a simple template; each new game is a new acquisition surface.
* **CFB breadth**: add more assets/timeframes; leaderboards and seasons increase retention.
* **Events to campaigns**: event attendance â†’ quest claims â†’ token payouts â†’ reâ€‘engagement in games/CFB.
* **Trust & proof**: public payout stats, provable oracle reports, and fast withdrawals build reputation â†’ lower CAC.
* **Localization**: geo/area buckets enable cityâ€‘level communities and events; content localization (EN/TH first).

---

## 8) How the App Helps Crypto Projects

* **Turn community into measurable actions**: quests drive follows, joins, AMAs, content shares, and event attendance with antiâ€‘abuse checks.
* **Fast distribution**: instant, idempotent payouts in FZ/PT/STAR; optional FUZE rewards.
* **Insightful reporting**: cohort performance, quest completion dropâ€‘offs, and eventâ€‘linked conversions.
* **Flexible promotion surfaces**: featured discovery cards, sponsored CFB slates, campaign pinning.
* **Low integration cost**: no smart contract required for v1; onâ€‘chain adapters later for trustless flows.

---

## 9) System Overview (brief)

* **Identity Service** â€” Telegram auth, users, roles, geo buckets.
* **Payhub** â€” ledger, balances, holds/settlements, conversions.
* **PlayHub** â€” games + **CFB** (owner vs pool, 7% rake, oracle TWAP).
* **Discovery** â€” watchlists, alerts, news, signals.
* **Campaigns** â€” quests/airdrops with proof checks and payouts.
* **Escrow** â€” P2P OTC with dual holds and disputes.
* **Events** â€” directory and external booking links.
* **Workers** â€” async jobs, reconcilers, DLQs.
* **Config & Infra** â€” versioned flags/limits, IaC, CI/CD, observability.

> See each serviceâ€™s README for endpoints, ENV, deploy, and tests.

## 10) KPIs & Guardrails (first pass)

* **Activation**: % of Telegram sessions that mint a session token and visit 2+ surfaces.
* **Liquidity**: total holds/settlements per day; CFB S\_owner/S\_acc ratios; escrow volume.
* **Monetization**: rake revenue (CFB/games), spreads (conversions), campaign spend.
* **Trust**: settlement success rate, orphan-hold age, withdrawal SLA, dispute resolution time.
* **Safety**: abuse flags per 1k actions; failed proof rates; KYC passâ€‘through (when enabled).

---

## 11) Roadmap Highlights

* **Phaseâ€‘1 (MVP)**: offâ€‘chain custody, CFB v1 with STAR/FZ/PT, 1â€“2 games, discovery basics, campaigns simple tasks, events directory, escrow sameâ€‘currency, price service optional.
* **Phaseâ€‘2**: FUZE fee discounts & staking tiers, more games, richer discovery/providers, onâ€‘chain adapters (custody/oracle), advanced escrow templates, creator SDK.

## 13) Compliance & Trust (quick note)

This app involves **betting** and **payouts**. Always review local regulations (licensing, KYC/AML, age gating). The architecture supports feature flagging per region, responsible gaming controls (limits, cooldowns, selfâ€‘exclusion), audit logs, and data export/deletion.

---

## 14) Getting Started (dev quickstart)

1. Boot **Identity** and **Payhub**, then **PlayHub**.
2. Run **WebApp** with your Telegram botâ€™s WebApp URL (ngrok for local).
3. Optional: run **Workers** and **Price Service** for CFB.
4. Use **Config** repo to enable/disable features and set limits.

Happy building! ðŸš€
